# ICS4Portfolio
This is my portfolio for the ICS4U course I am currently taking. The portfolio will contain tutorials on all topics learned in the course, and additional information about myself.

As of 4/14/2023, the repository contains all the completed tutorials written in markdown.

## TODO
 - Create a website to display the tutorials
 - Add personal content such as CTF writeups and my mathematics experience
 - Tutorials should include common mistakes as well as a few more challenging problems. Specifically, Searching should have a proper problem as an example. Arrays and ArrayLists as well.
