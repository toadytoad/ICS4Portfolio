## What if I've filled up my array?
Not to worry! ArrayLists have come to the rescue. ArrayLists support arbitrary sizes of arrays, to which you can continue adding elements. To create an ArrayList of Strings, use the following syntax:

```java
List<String> lst = new ArrayList<>();
```

With this list you may now add elements, remove elements, and so much more, as Java implements tons of useful methods that act on ArrayLists. Refer to the official Oracle JavaDocs on ArrayLists to explore more that ArrayLists can do.

An important note is that to create an ArrayList of built in datatypes, use the datatypes object counterpart. For example, isntead of int, using Integer, and instead of long, use Long.
